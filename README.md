# 📈 AI Trading Intelligence Framework (MCP Server)

A powerful, multi-agent Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that transforms Claude (or any MCP client) into an autonomous financial analysis firm. By deploying specialized AI agents—Technical Analyst, Sentiment Analyst, and Risk Manager—the framework collaboratively evaluates real-time market conditions and delivers consensus-driven trading decisions.

## 🤖 The Multi-Agent Architecture

Unlike basic screeners, this framework decomposes complex trading tasks into specialized roles to ensure robust, scalable decision-making:

1. **🛠️ Technical Analyst Agent**: Evaluates intrinsic price action using Bollinger Bands (proprietary rating from -3 to +3), RSI, and MACD.
2. **🌊 Sentiment & Momentum Analyst**: Analyzes recent price momentum, MACD crossovers, and RSI trends to gauge short-term market mood.
3. **🛡️ Risk Manager**: Continuously evaluates portfolio risk by assessing market volatility (Bollinger Band Width) and mean reversion risk against major moving averages (SMA20, EMA200).

*Agents debate their findings in real-time to output a single logical framework decision: `STRONG BUY`, `BUY`, `HOLD`, `SELL`, or `STRONG SELL` with calculated confidence levels.*

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5-Minute Setup)

### Option 1: Docker (Fastest)

Run the framework immediately on port 8080:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8000 atilaahmettaner/tradingview-mcp:latest
```

**Claude Desktop Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tradingview-mcp": {
      "command": "curl",
      "args": ["-s", "http://localhost:8080/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```
*(For Cursor/Windsurf, just use the SSE URL: `http://localhost:8080/sse`)*

### Option 2: Python / PyPI

Install the package directly:
```bash
uv tool install tradingview-mcp
# or standard pip:
pip install tradingview-mcp
```

**Claude Desktop Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tradingview-mcp": {
      "command": "tradingview-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Direct Git Execution (No Installation)

1. **Install UV Package Manager:**
   ```bash
   brew install uv  # macOS
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  # Linux
   ```

2. **Claude Desktop Configuration:**
   ```json

   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tradingview-mcp": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "tool", "run", "--from",
           "git+https://github.com/atilaahmettaner/tradingview-mcp.git",
           "tradingview-mcp"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** - The framework is now loaded and your AI Analyst firm is ready!

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**1. "No data found" errors / Empty Arrays:**
- Try different exchanges (KuCoin usually works best for Crypto).
- Standardise timeframes (15m, 1h, 1D).
- You may have hit TradingView's rate limits. Wait 5-10 minutes.

**2. Claude Desktop not detecting the server:**
- Restart Claude Desktop after adding configuration.
- Check that UV is installed: `uv --version`.
- Verify the configuration JSON syntax.

## 🤝 Contributing & Development

We welcome contributions from researchers, traders, and engineers to expand our analytical models!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atilaahmettaner/tradingview-mcp.git
cd tradingview-mcp
uv sync
